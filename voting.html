             Note - each contest is effectively a separate page.  The contest next button (there
             are several ways to get to the next, previous, or random other contest) resets
             the two lists to the current state of the (new) contest.

             Note that contests can be in one of three states: un-voted, undervoted, or
             voted.  The progress bar is divided into the contest number of sections, each
             section from left to rigth representing a contest.  The coloring is as follows:

             green     -> voted (completed)
             yellow    -> undervoted
             red       -> there are two cases when a progress bar section is red: a) when the
                          contest is unvoted when there is a yellow or green contest to the
                          right, or b) when the voter is on the checkout/cast-vote final page
             uncolored -> unvoted when there are no yellows/greens to the right and when the
                          voter is not on the final checkout/cast page

             For now, just stub out five contests and pretend this is the first one being
             being revisted after skipping the first two and completing the third one
